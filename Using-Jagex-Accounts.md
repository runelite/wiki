### Using Jagex Accounts

If you have converted your account to a Jagex Account and can no longer login directly to RuneLite, but want to do RuneLite development, follow this guide:

1. Make sure your _RuneLite launcher_ is version 2.6.3 or newer
2. For Windows, run `RuneLite (configure)` from the start menu. Otherwise, pass `--configure` to the launcher (i.e. `/Applications/RuneLite.app/Contents/MacOS/RuneLite --configure` on Mac).
3. In the `Client arguments` input box add `--insecure-write-credentials`
4. Click Save
5. Launch RuneLite via the Jagex launcher. RuneLite will write your launcher credentials to `.runelite/credentials.properties`. **Do not share this file with anyone.**
6. Launch RuneLite client (eg. via the IDE) and it will use the saved credentials.

Once you've finished development you can delete the `credentials.properties` file to return your Runelite back to normal.
