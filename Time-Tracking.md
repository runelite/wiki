## Settings

### 1. Show Relative Time

(Default Off) When enabled, instead of showing you what time your harvest will be ready ("Done at 17:40"), it will show you how long until your harvest is ready ("Done in 1h 30m").



## `::resetfarmtick` Chat Command

In rare cases where the timers for farming patches get desynced, you can type `::resetfarmtick` into the games chatbox to reset the timers.
Standing by a wood tree patch and seeing it grow will restore the timers.
