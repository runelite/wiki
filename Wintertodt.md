### Notify When

This is when you are notified. Options are as follows

![](img/wintertodt/wintertodt_notify_options.png)

None will never notify you.
Damage taken will notify on any damage regardless of if you are interrupted like when you are chopping bruma logs.
Action Interrupted will notify you only when something caused you to go idle, such as when the brazier goes out.
Both is simply the two above options at the same time.
