The World Hopper plugin adds a sidebar panel listing all the Oldschool Runescape worlds, their regions, their activities, and their populations. Double-clicking any of the world entries will trigger a world hop to that world. In addition, this plugin adds a "Hop-to" menu option to the Friend's List and Clan Chat for players on other worlds. It also adds quick-hop shortcuts to hop to the next and previous worlds in the world list.
