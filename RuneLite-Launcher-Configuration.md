# RuneLite Launcher Configuration

The RuneLite Launcher Configuration window was added in launcher version 2.6.3, released March 5, 2023.
To update your launcher please visit the [RuneLite website](https://runelite.net/) and select to download the setup file for your Operating System then install the launcher using that.

The Configure window can be then opened by selecting the `RuneLite (configure)` start menu entry, on Windows, or if using Mac/Linux by passing the command line argument `--configure` to the launcher

The Configuration Window allows all launcher and client arguments to be configured and saved for use on any subsequent launch.
The configuration is also saved in such a way that when launching RuneLite through the Jagex Launcher they are also applied.
