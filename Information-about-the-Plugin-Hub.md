The [Plugin Hub](https://runelite.net/plugin-hub) is a feature introduced in RuneLite 1.6 that allows niche plugins to be created fast and maintained by their creator without having to go through the normal submission process. This also allows them to be released at any time, instead of having to wait for the client release.

# How to use the Plugin Hub

Using the Plugin Hub is very simple

1. Open the plugin configuration panel.

# FAQ / Troubleshooting

### Are the plugins safe? The message at the top is worrying me

Trusted RuneLite developers check over the plugins before they are added to the Hub to see if they are fine under Jagex's 3rd Party Statement. The warning at the top of the Plugin Hub is because we don't guarantee that the plugins in the hub will actually work, or that they won't crash your game and kill your HCIM.

The Plugin Hub can be thought of like a phone's App Store:

* In an App Store, you can download vetted apps made by 3rd parties (aka not your phone OS's developer), at any time you want, and those developers can update their apps or add new apps without having to wait for a system update.

* In the Plugin Hub, you download vetted plugins made by 3rd parties, at any time you want, and plugins can be updated or new plugins added without having to wait for a RuneLite update.

### The plugin hub list isn't loading!

The Plugin Hub only works on the Release versions of RuneLite. 
If you are running the Release and it's still not working, make sure nothing is blocking RuneLite from accessing `https://repo.runelite.net`.

### A plugin in the Hub isn't working!

All bugs and requests relating to Plugin Hub plugins should be discussed with the plugin's developer. Clicking the ![?](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2979691/75092785-4b3b5100-5573-11ea-9dbe-815730b36afa.png)
 button next to the install/remove button in the Hub will take you to the developer's GitHub repo, where you can report an issue just like you would for RuneLite.

### I have an idea for an external plugin

Feature Requests can be made to the RuneLite repo as normal. **Please check for duplicates before posting**. If you think the feature should definitely be in the Hub, mention it in the request.
