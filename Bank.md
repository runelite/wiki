## Settings

### Bank value in bank title

Toggles display of the combined Grand Exchange or high alchemy price of the current tab's bank items. There is an option to show the exact value as well.
This can also be enabled for the seed vault.

### Disable left click bank inventory and equipment

Disables left-click on the bank inventory, equipment, looting bag, and placeholder buttons in the bottom left of the bank and deposit box interface.

### Keyboard Bankpin

Allows the use of keyboard keys for bank pin input.

### Advanced searching

- `qty > 10` all stacks with more than 10 items.

- `ha > 5k` or `alch > 5k` all item stacks with a combined high alch value greater than 5k gp.

- `ge > 1m` all item stacks with a combined ge value greater than 1m gp.

- Individual item value search: use `per` to search per item instead of per stack, e.g. `ha per > 1m`.

#### Notes

- `i`, `iv`, and `individual` can also be used instead of `per` e.g. `hai>3k`.

- Spaces may be omitted from all of these queries.
