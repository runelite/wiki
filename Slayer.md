Along with a mouse tooltip on hover containing your points and streak

Note that RuneLite gets the information on your Slayer task when you receive the task or when you check the Slayer gem. RuneLite keeps its own counter for display in the infobox. This also means RuneLite's counter can become out of sync with the real counter, for instance when you make a few kills when not using RuneLite.

### Bursting and Cannons
Runelite currently gets kill count information based on your xp drops so if you manage to kill multiple enemies in the same tick Runelite can only register that as one kill which will get out of sync if doing bursting or cannoning a task.
