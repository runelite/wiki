# Ground Marker Configuration

The Ground Markers plugin allows user to mark tiles around the world. Marking tiles can be done by holding the **shift key** and right clicking the tile you want to mark and then click "Mark tile" in the menu.

Removing a marked tiles follows the same principle, shift right click the tile and select the menu option again to remove the tile.

Marked tiles can also be labeled by shift right clicking the desired previously marked tile.
