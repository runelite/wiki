# Ground Marker Configuration

The Ground Markers plugin allows user to mark tiles around the world. Marking tiles can be done by holding the **shift key** and right clicking the tile you want to mark and then click "Mark tile" in the menu.

You are able to do the following with a marked tile in that same shift right click menu:

- Unmark (delete)

- Label

- Color  
![color tile](img/ground-markers/ground_markers_color.png)

The plugin also remembers which tiles you have marked between sessions.

## Importing / Exporting

Right-click the World Map orb by the minimap to import or export ground markers. Importing will check your system clipboard for a ground marker import string. Exporting will copy the ground markers in the area around you to the system clipboard.

Ground marker import strings look like this: `[{"regionId":12850,"regionX":22,"regionY":19,"z":0,"color":"#FF000000"},{"regionId":12850,"regionX":21,"regionY":19,"z":0,"color":"#FFDC8700"}]`.

To export all tile markers, sign in to RuneLite and enable cloud sync on the profile that has the tile markers, then visit https://runelite.net/account/tile-markers and click "Export Tile markers".
