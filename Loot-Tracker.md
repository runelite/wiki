# Loot Tracker

![](img/loot-tracker/loot_tracker_panel.png)

The Loot Tracker plugin adds a sidebar panel which tracks the contents and value of items dropped while killing monsters, other players, and drops from some other activities such as Barrows, Chambers of Xeric, Theatre of Blood, and Clue Scrolls.

## RuneLite Account

While logged in with a RuneLite [Account](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Account), the loot tracker will remember your loot across client restarts. Loot for a particular event (such as Barrows, a clue scroll reward, or a drop from Zulrah) will be kept until 90 days after the most recent loot for that specific event. If you receive loot from an event at least once every 90 days the loot will be remembered indefinitely.

The loot can also be reviewed on the website at https://runelite.net/account/loot-tracker
