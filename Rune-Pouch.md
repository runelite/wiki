## Options

### Font Color
The text color in the tooltip and overlay.

### Display mode
Whether to display the item overlay (`Inventory`), the tooltip (`Mouse hover`), or both.

## Divine rune pouch
When you have 4 different runes in your rune pouch, the overlay changes to use a bar to show how many runes you have.
The bar is green when you have more than 1000 runes of a type, and turns red when you go below 1000 runes.

n.b. the green bar displays as full anytime you have more than 10k runes.
