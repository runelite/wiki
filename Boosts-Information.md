### Use Relative Boosts

### Display next change

Displays a countdown from 60 seconds (or 90 seconds with Preserve activated) that indicates when stats are naturally restored by 1. The client has to see a combat buff (e.g. attack potion) drain once per ingame session to be able to display the combat buff drain timer. This is not required for the non-combat buff drain timer or the debuff restoration timer. 

### Boost Amount Threshold

The amount of levels boosted at which the value is displayed in a different color. A value of `0` disables the feature.

### Notify on boost threshold

Configures whether or not to send a notification when the `Boost amount threshold` is reached.
