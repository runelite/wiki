# Connection Issues

In rare occasions, Internet Service Providers have issues on their end preventing users from connecting to [RuneLite's website](https://runelite.net/), which is a requirement for starting RuneLite. While this problem is not the fault of the user, it can often be mitigated with one of the workarounds listed below.

#### Previously known issues:
**Globe** in The Philippines had this issue in December of 2023
**Kcom** in The United Kingdom had this issue from 2023-12-20 to 2023-12-21
**Xfinity/Comcast** on the East coast of The United States had this issue on 2023-06-17
**Xfinity/Comcast** on the West coast of The United States had this issue on 2023-05-02

**__Possible workarounds:__**
- Use a VPN when launching RuneLite[^1] (it can be turned off before logging in to the game)
- Use your mobile phone's internet to launch RuneLite (WiFi or USB tethering)
- [Manually change your DNS server](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-change-your-pcs-dns-settings-windows-10#article-46409:~:text=Open%20Control%20Panel.)
- Use the normal OSRS client

**Steps to use a VPN**
1) Install a free VPN such as [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/support/protonvpn-windows-vpn-application/)
2) Set your country to the United States (or UK, or others)
3) Launch RuneLite with the VPN activated
4) Disconnect from the VPN before logging in to the game
5) Log in to the game as normal
6) If you close the client, you'll have to repeat steps 3-5 every time you open RuneLite, at least until the problem has been fixed for your area.

[^1]: This option may not be possible for Jagex Accounts, as the Jagex launcher is known to prevent VPN usage.
